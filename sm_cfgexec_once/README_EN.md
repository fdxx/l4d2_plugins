## About
Use the command to execute the specified configuration file once.

## Notes
Since `AutoExecConfig/server.cfg` is executed after every map change and overrides the dynamically modified cvar values in the game, The purpose of this plugin is to set the initial cvar value for other plugins. For example, add it to `server.cfg`:

```c
sm_cfgexec_once "addons/file.cfg"
```

This will ensure that `file.cfg` is executed only once.

## Command
```c
// Admin command. Executes the specified configuration file, Relative to the `left4dead2/` directory.
// Multiple files are separated using `;`
sm_cfgexec_once <path/file1;path/file2>
```
